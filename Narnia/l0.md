# OTW - Narnia Notes
## Level: 0

We have access to the following files:
* `narnia0` - Compiled code
* `narnia0.c` - Src code

Taking a look at the src code in `narnia0.c`: 

* We can see that the program will read a user input and store it's value in a variable __buf[20]__

* Our __goal__ is to overrite the value of the variable __val__ so that it matches "`0xdeadbeef`"

* Additionally, the __scanf()__ used to read in the user input can read __24 bytes__ of data - If we are to enter a big enough input we should be able to overrite adjacent memory location of __val__

## Command Ran

```bash
(echo -e "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xef\xbe\xad\xde"; cat;) | ./narnia0
```
__Logic__:
* The `echo` is used to output a big enough string, where the first 20 chars are irrelevant and remaining part - __\xef\xbe\xad\xde__ is used to represent the string __"deadbeef"__ in hex encoding for systems using little endian formatting.

* The `cat` command is used to keep the shell open (as running the command with cat will result in the shell closing immediately 
  * From what I understand this is because the shell that opens up is not running in an interactive mode/terminal, it detects this and closes up automatically

* We pipe the output from `echo` command + the `cat` command to `./narnia0` which gives us the password for the next levels
