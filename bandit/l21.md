This lvl introduces cron and crontab

We inspect a cronjob that is being performed at regular intervals, 
From there we find a script is being executed
Inspecting the script - we find that the password for lvl 22 is being copied 
into a temp file (`/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`)

Running:
 `cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`

gives us the password for the next lvl

Password for lvl 22:
