for this level we had to run a port scan betweeen ports 31000-32000 on localhost to find open ports. 

1 of the open ports was running an SSL/TLS server that will give the creds to next level
We had to pass the password for the curr lvl to it

Ran:

`nmap -T4 -sV -p 31000-32000 localhost` - to get list of open ports with services they're running)
* was stuck in this step as nmap scan wasn't working, got the right port no. from a walkthrough

Got the rsa private key for l17

Password for l17 (for future ref):
