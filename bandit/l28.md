for this lvl we had to clone a git repo (on ssh using custom port - 2220)
and then view the git logs to find the password for the next level

Ran:

1. `git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo` -- cloning the repo
2. `git log` -- to view past changes made to the repo
3. `git show <commit id/name>` -- to view specific commits and differences in files before & after commits

Password for l29:
