For this level, we had to send the password for the current level to local host on port 30001,
using ssl/tls

Ran:
`echo "8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo" | ncat --ssl localhost 30001`

Password for l16: 
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

**Side Note:
Very grateful for the people behind overthewire.org, absolute giga chads
