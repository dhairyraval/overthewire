had to find a file on the server which matches this:
owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

Ran: `find . -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null`

The `2>/dev/null` part pipes the stderr to `/dev/null` (helps keep the output concise and unclutured)

File Path (for future ref): `./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`
