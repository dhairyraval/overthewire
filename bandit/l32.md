for this lvl we had to escape a shell that we'd login into when connecting as bandit32

The shell would turn all our commands to upper case and wouldn't let us run any commands.

Running:
 - `$0` (ref to default shell) -- we get into a regular shell  
	*Note: We're able to run `$0` as this is a ref to a variable and uppercase shell doesn't affect such commands*

 - `ls -al` -- to list all files, permissions, properties  
	* Here we find that the uppercase shell is owned by user bandit33  
	* So right now, any command in this regular shell, inside of the uppercase shell will be run as bandit33

 - `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33` -- to get the password for the next lvl

**At the time of writing this is the last level for bandit!**
