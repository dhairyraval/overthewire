For this level we needed to pass the password for this level (l14) to the localhost on port 30000

Ran:
`nc "<l14-pass>" localhost 30000`

*notes:
- Tried looking up how to list all the active nc listeners running from our user
  - was curious to see if I could find the localhost listener

Password for l15:
