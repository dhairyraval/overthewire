For this lvl we again look at cronjobs and inspect the script running for bandit24

Here we find that the script runs all the scripts owned by user=bandit23 that are
present in the following folder (and deletes them after 60s):
`/var/spool/bandit24/foo`

So we add a script to this folder which gets run automatically by cronjobs as
the user bandit24

*Note:
I added the file directly in the `/var/spool/bandit24/foo` folder & set the `+x`
permissions in 1 command, however I realized now that it's probably easier to 
create the script file in `/tmp`, set x permissions, and then `mv` it to `/var/...`

Script I used:

```
#!/bin/bash
myname=$(whoami)
cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/<password-file>
```

Command to create the file and set permissions:
`vim <script-name>.sh; chmod +x <script-name>.sh`

Now the password for bandit24 is printed(?) into `/tmp/<password-file>`

Password for lvl24:
