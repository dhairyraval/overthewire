For this lvl we again look at a cronjob (cronjob_bandit23)

Here we see that the following shell script is being executed:
`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh`

Inspecting the shell script, we see that it's basically getting the password for 
the next lvl (23) and saving it in a temp file with the following naming format:
	`/tmp/<md5sum("I am user bandit23")>`

Running the following commad we can get the md5hash:
`echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1`

Password for l23:
