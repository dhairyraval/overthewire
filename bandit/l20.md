For this lvl we have a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

-For this lvl we need to do the following:

1. Start up a nc listner on any random port of our choice (eg: 1234),
	we also need to send the password for curr lvl to any connections that are made
	
	For this I ran: 
	`echo -n "0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO" | nc -l -p 1234 &`
	- `-n`: prevent newline character from printing
	- `&`: Backgrounds the process

2. Now we just execute the setuid binary and pass the port number for our nc listner as a cmd linearg

	`Ran: ./suconnect 1234`

Password for l21:
