For this lvl we needed to send the password of the curr lvl + a 4 digit pin code to a daemon listning
on port 30002

It's mentioned that we will have to go through all 10,000 possible combinations of pin codes (brute force)

Ran:
`seq -w 0001 9999 | sed 's/^/gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 /' | nc -v localhost 30002`

* `seq`: Command to generate sequences of numbers
*  `-w`: Flag to ensure that numbers have the same width (padding them with leading 0s if needed)
* `sed`: stream editor - processes text line by line
* `'s/^/<curr-pass> /'`: Expression to add the current password at the beginning of output by seq

* `nc -v ...`: nc command to send the output to localhost on port 30002

Password for l25:
