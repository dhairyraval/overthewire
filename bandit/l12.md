The password was in a file that was a hexdump of a file that was compressed multiple times using gzip2, tar, bzip2

After creating a temp dir, I moved the file to itand renamed it to change file ext (although this step was not necessary)

Then we run: `xxd -r d.hex d.bin` -- to convert file into binary

Then it just a combination of running the right decompression command (gunzip, bunzip2, tar) depending on what type of compression was used previously (we can check that by running: file filename)
