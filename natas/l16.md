Did look up at a write for this one as well :(

We can mainuplate the following grep command in the code:
	`grep -i \"$key\" dictionary.txt`

If we write a script to automate, we could try something like:
	`grep -i \"$(grep $c /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)\" dictionary.txt`

- Where `$c` is anything in **[0-9]** or **[a-z]** or **[A-Z]**

- The logic is that, if the inner grep is able to find a match, then the result of the whole cmd would be empty, as inner grep selects the password string
and outter grep wouldn't be find a match for it in the `dictionary.txt` file

If the inner grep does not match we will see the whole dictionary being printed out

- Also would have to run this twice - the 2nd time would be a reverse run where we check prepending chars
- Used a python script for this level - named `script16.py`
