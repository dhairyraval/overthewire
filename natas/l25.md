Landing page has some (let's say interesting) text

We can select the language the page is displayed in - which shows us the **lang query** param
in the URL -- we probably have to edit this param

Looking at the src code:
- The function of interest is `safeinclude()`

- `safeinclude($filename)` checks for:

    - directory traversal using `strstr()` to detect `'../'` in `$filename`
    and `str_replace()` to replace `'../'` with `""` in `$filename`

    - If `$filename` contains **"natas_webpass"**, it's deetected using `strstr()` and the function exits

    - There's a comment of `//add more checks. . .` but there are no furthur
    checks in the function - This is probably a clue that we can modify the 
    `$filename` to get some info or password


- If we use **"....//"** in the lang string 
  - `str_replace()` will replace the middle part of **"../"** from **"....//"** and give us: **"../"** as a result -- Got this part from a hint from chatGPT 

 - We can use this to access the log file, and here we take advantage of the fact that the user-agent from the req headers gets logged in without sanitization

* We can use **BurpSuite**/browser extensions (**requestly**) to edit the user-agent to get the password for the next level
