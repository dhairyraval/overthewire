This level is similar to l12, but now the `exif_imagetype()` function is being used
- this function is used to prevent malicious files being uploaded instead of image files
- The function works by reading the first few bytes of a file i.e. **the file signature**
- This determines the type of the file


Right off the bat, **tried uploading a php file but with the headers of a jpg**
Aaaand that worked
