So the landing page mentions that it's using same code as l18, but this time the session IDs are no longer sequential. 

- **Tf that mean?**
	The Session IDs are no longer assigned in the format of: 1,2,3, . . .
	But it could be a combination of random number, encoded values, alphanumeric chars
	- Basically, brute forcing is much harder without establishing a valid pattern
	that's being followed by the new Session IDs

- A few random Session IDs that I got by trying multiple login attempts:
	```
	3233342d61646d696e (username - admin)
	3339302d61646d696e (username - admin)
	3437372d61646d696e (username - admin)
	3332352d61646d696e (username - admin)
	38362d61646d696e (username - admin)

	3631362d74657374 (random username)
	3235352d626c6164 (random username)
	3330352d7177647771 (random username)
	```
	
- Figured out that the **cookie value are hex-encoded**, converting them to ascii
gives something like: `x-admin` where `x` is a random number (im assuming between 1 - 640,		based on the prev level)

- Wrote the script to brute force different session IDs untill we find the right one --  `script19.py`
