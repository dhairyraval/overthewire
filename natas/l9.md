For this level we're sending input to a form and it's being used to display words containing our input string

Looking at the php code - it's referencing a list of words in a file called `dictionary.txt`

Figured that we could use command injection for this input form

Initially, i tried to get the server to `console.log()` the password for natas10
 - realized that `console.log` would be a client side - JS function and 
wont work on server side - even if it did, it won't log the password on my (client)
browser

Figured we could run `cat` to get the password printed on the page, ran this:
`;cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10`

Password for l10:
