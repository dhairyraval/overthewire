This was another easy one

Looking at the src code we see that we need to supply a password that
satisfies this if condition:

`if(strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"],"iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] > 10 ))`

- Needs to contain the text "iloveyou"
- "Passwd-string" > 10 - should evaluate to true

Basically any string for the following format would work:
`"<any_number_bigger_10>iloveyou"`

Password for l24:
