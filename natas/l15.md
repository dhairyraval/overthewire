For this level we again have an input field for username, but now we can only check if the user exists or not

- Running `admin" OR "1" = "1` , and `admin` (separately) confirms that sql injection is working  
	- looking at the src code also confirms this lol  

- Randomly tried entering `natas16` - and it says the user exists  
	So im thinking that we need to inject an sql command to access and print natas16's password  
	- Looking at the php code - it's only going to print if the user exists or not
	- Don't think we can manipulate the input to get something printed, but it will run the query supplied.  

- Used deepSeek for hints: It mentioned that as this is a **blind sql injection** where we only get output in a **true/false** format - we can inject sql queries to get more info about natas16's password  

- Ref to write up - we'd have to make a script and check the existence of each character of natas16's psswd  
- Created the script in this folder: `script15.py`  

- The level itself wasn't very hard once I understoof the concept of how blind sql injection works
