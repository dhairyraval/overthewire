For this level we have a CSS Style Experimenter website along with the default website

We need to somehow get the admin session in the default page, by exploiting some input vulnerability in the CSS Style Experimenter example form 


- wasted 2 hrs trying to figure out why my requests were not able to update the SESSION variables
  - I forgot to add "submit" = "1" in the web request
  - Basically, I was sending all the inputs but not clicking on the submit button on the form

Adding an extra `key:value` pair into the session variable (`admin:1`), sending that req to the experimenter site, and then we get the *PHPSESSID* assigned to the admin account

Use that PHPSESSID cookie value on the main site and done!
