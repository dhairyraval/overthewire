For this level, all we had to do was send a GET req to the server,
while adding some extra params, session data and disallowing redirects

- Adding a "revelio" parameter - value could be anything 
- Adding an `admin:1` key-value pair to the SESSION
- Dissallowing auto redirect using `allow_redirects=False` in GET req

Short, sweet, simple level, used the `script22.py`
