Looking at the landing page - we see that there is a form input with submit btn,
	similar to l6 (or l5, cant remember)

Looking at the php code in the src
We see that the function `encodeSecret` -- converts the given string to base64, then reverses it, and then converts it to hex format, and then compares it to a string `$encodedSecret`

we should get the correct secret for the input form - giving us the password for the next level

`secret for l8: oubWYf2kBq`

Password for l9:
