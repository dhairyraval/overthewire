For this level we have to modify a session cookie
**Note**: Editting the cookies (for ex: setting the **PHPSESSID** to 1)
	and then adding a `?debug` to the end of the URL before refreshing will give
	you the debug info

- Had to see a walkthrough for this - basically we would have to try all possible sessions IDs (PHPSESSID) to find the one associated with the admin user

- We have to manual go through the session IDs as we can't really provide the form with any creds that would make a diff in the code - as the `isValidAdminLogin()` function will always return 0

- What threw me off, was that I tried editing my (client-side) session storage and tried adding a `key:value` pair of `admin:1`
	- This doesn't work as the auth is happening on the server side by checking
	what the client-side PHPSESSID is and cross-ref it to the stored session data
