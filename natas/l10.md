This level is the same as l9, except now the characters `;` and `&` are being filtered out

Looked up a write up for this as deepseek sent me down a side tangent

We can manipulate how the grp command works and the lack of input validation for this level

If we give this input as:
`a /etc/natas_webpass/natas11`

On the server side the command would read like this:
`grep -i a /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 dictionary.txt`

Basically, grep will try searching for all line that contain the character `a`
in both the natas11 password file and dictionary.txt - printing the password as the first line
