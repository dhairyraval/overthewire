Notes for level 12:

First a variable `$target_path` is created using:
`$target_path = makeRandomPathFromFilename("upload", $_POST["filename"]);`

the function `makeRandomPathFromFilename()`
- Creates a path with the following format:
  - `upload/<random-10-chracters>.<ext of file uploaded>`

* Tried exploring command injection by passing it as a file-name (specifically, as a hidden filename with '.')
	- Don't feel like it's this, because uploading hidden files seems like a pain

* Tried getting some hints from chatGPT/DeepSeek - def something to do with command injection through the file being uploaded

* Decided to ref to a write-up for some hints - the solution based on **injecting php commands** in the file and uploading a php file.

* Lesson learned: Be more patient when reading and understanding the code
