This level looks similar to l15, but now we can't see any outputs from the given form

Things to note:
- The query is still being executed without validation:
	```
	$query = "SELECT * from users where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\"";
	```
- Using chatGPT for this hints: We could potentially use a **time based SQL injection** method
- Basically delaying the query if a match is found/not found

- Running this input for testing:
	`natas18" AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) -- `
  - The trailing space at the end of line in the above input is needed
because sql wont treat `--` as a comment if it's directly trailed by another
char

Using the `response.elapsed.total_seconds()` built-in function to check for delays in response

Building my own script (script17.py)- using script15.py as a ref
