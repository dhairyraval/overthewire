For this level we neeed to supply a password string that matchesa `<censored>` string

We know this because: the i`f(!strcmp($_REQUEST["passwd"],"<censored>"))`
will only be true if: `passwd === <censored>`

- I tried running `strcmp("{$a}","$a")` for any random string `$a` and
this evaluates to 0

- Maybe If I can find the variable name used to store the `<censored>` string
- Tried the following:
    - censored
    - passwd

- Realized that this method probably wont work for a couple of reasons:
    1. Not sure if user input will be dynamically interpreted (eg: using `eval()`)
    2. There's no real way to get the variable name - not from from what we know and have access to

- Looked up a write up, realized that if we pass the input as something other than a string then `strcmp()` outputs `NULL` (in php `NULL == 0` (loosly)) thus `!NULL == 1`

**NOTE:**
I got very side-tracked when I tried running `!strcmp([],"testString")` on my local machine as this would only throwing an error 

After some digging around I realized that Natas challenges use an older version of PHP (5.x) where strcmp only throws a warning when trying to compare 2 different data types, newer versions have stricter type handling.
