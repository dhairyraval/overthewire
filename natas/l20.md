For this level we again need to login as admin to get creds for the next level

This time we can only supply our name as input

- For this level, we are trying to exploit how the session IDs are being created and read in the back-end by taking advantage of no input validation for the `name` field in the form

- Command ran:
	```
	curl -isu natas20:p5mCvP7GS2K6Bmt3gqhM2Fc1A5T8MVyw -b "PHPSESSID=bh0j0s900i3ebho2kd1d7206ju" "http://natas20.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?name=admin%0Aadmin%201" --cookie "PHPSESSID=hello"
	```

- **Logic:** We're trying to enter `<whatever-name>\nadmin 1` as our input for the name field
  - This way the `mywrite()` function will create an extra entry in the session file it creates
  - Then when we try running the same command again, the `myread()` function will read the session file and interpret the extra line as us being the admin user
  - The 2nd line basically states `$SESSION["admin"] = 1` ( validating us in the `print_credentials()` )

**Notes**
- Looking into why the validation for `$sid` is needed in `myread()` and `mywrite()` functions?
  - This is not related to solving the lvl, just curious
  - Prevent us from trying path traversal attacks as this line of the code could allow that, if `$sid` was not checked: `$filename = session_save_path() . "/" . "mysess_" . $sid`
