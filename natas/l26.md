We need to create a **base64_encoded** cookie for a serialized object of the Logger class

When initially reading the code, I was stuck trying to figure out where the object for the logger class was . . . then realized that we can make our own, override the `_contruct()` function and edit the values for `logFile` & `exitMsg`
