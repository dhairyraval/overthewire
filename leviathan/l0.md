For this lvl - I listed all the files in curr directory using
`ls -al`

There is a hidden file called `.backups` which is owned by leviathan1 - that gives a big hint
Inside `.backups`, we find `bookamrks.html` - this file probably contains the password but has way too much info 
to manually parse

I ran:
`grep "password" bookmarks.html` -- returns an entry for an anchor tag which contains the password for leviathan1

Password for lev1:
