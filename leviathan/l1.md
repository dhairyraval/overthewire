For this level we had a 'check' executable file present in the home dir
this file has the **-suid** bit set so we know that running this will run it as leviathan2
However it needed a password in order to run

(after speding some time googling): I found that ltrace can be used to trace the functions calls being made when we run this executable

Looking at the function calls we can see that, `strcmp()` function is being used to compare the password we input against the string "sex" -- this is the password to run the file

Running the file, opens lev2's shell - going to `/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2` give us the password

Password for lev2:
NsN1HwFoyN
