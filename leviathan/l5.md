For this level we are given an executable file with **suid** bit set (owner - lev6)

We can run this executable as leviathan6, this executable file is looking for a `/tmp/file.log` file

Using Symlink we can create a symbolink link and use `/tmp/file.log` to represent the link: `/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6`

Running:
`ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log && ./leviathan5`

Creates the symbolic link and then executes the script
