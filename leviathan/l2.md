For this lvl we a given a `printfile` with:
- suid bit set
- executable

I looked up the solution where we follow a "vulnurability" in the way `printfile`
executes
Reference: https://www.abatchy.com/2017/09/overthewire-leviathan

Basically we create a file name like `a; bash -p` for the input

- `printfile` tries to open up the file with the name `a` - it wont find it
- then (as user lev3) it executes the commads after the `;`

This is how we can get access to lev3's shell and retrive the password from `/etc/...`
