For this level we have an executable inside a hidden folder in the home dir

Running the executable gets us the password for the next level (confirmed by using `ltrace/strace`)

However the password is in **binary** (spearated by " ") and we need to convert it to **ascii**

Ran:
`./bin | tr -d " " | perl -lpe '$_=pack"B*",$_'`

The `perl -lpe '$_=pack"B*",$_'` part is used to convert the string of binary digits (which has no spaces, as we've first piped it to `tr -d " "`) into binary data


Password for the lev5:
