For this level we agian inspect the functions beings called by an executable file that present in the home dir

Running: 
`ltrace ./<file-name>`

We then see that the script asks for a password after running and compares it to a string **"snlprintf"**
Supplying this string as the input gives us access to a shell with leviathan4's UID (basically lev4's shell)

Password for lev4:
WG1egElCvO


**An Interesting Note:**
- Running the program in a debugging mode (using `ltrace/strace`) and supplying the correct string as password will result in getting lev3's shell
  - from what I understood, this happens becuase functions like `geteuid()` 
will either fail or fall back to a safer behavior to avoid security risks. Thought this was very cool
